### Go Quiz App 

The problem: 
- The task is to build a super simple quiz with a few questions and a few alternatives for each question. With one correct answer per question.
- Backend - Golang
- Database - Just in-memory , so no database
- REST API or gRPC
- CLI that talks with the API, preferably using https://github.com/spf13/cobra ( as cli framework )

User stories/Use cases
* User should be presented questions with a number of answers
* User should be able to select just one answer per question
* User should be able to answer all the questions and then post his/her answers and get back how many correct answers there had and be displayed to the user.
* User should see how good he/she rated compared to others that have taken the quiz, "You scored higher than 60% of all quizzers"
